### API using scikit-learn to make predictions 

We use the Flask framework to deploy our scikit-learn classifier to the web in this experiment. We will use the famous iris flower dataset, in which petal length, width and sepal length are used to predict the class of Iris flower. We can use this as a proof of concept for web-based ML prediction APIs, and develop more complex ones in the future.

Dependencies: Flask, scikit-learn
