### API using scikit-learn to make predictions 

The Flask framework is used to deploy our scikit-learn classifier to the web in this experiment. The dataset used is the famous iris flower dataset, in which petal length, width and sepal length are used to predict the class of Iris flower. Mostly a proof of concept for web-based ML prediction APIs, to develop more complex ones in the future.

Dependencies: Flask, scikit-learn, Pickle, numpy
